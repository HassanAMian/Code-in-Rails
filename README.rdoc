== Code in Rails 

This is a blog based on Mackenzie Child's 12in12 tutorial.  Functionally, following the tutorial got me what I needed, so any personal changes from the tutorial version would be in content, styling, and security.  

Code in Rails will be deployed as an actual blog where I will discuss various aspects of Ruby on Rails, so I can start contributing to the community.  More to come on that.
